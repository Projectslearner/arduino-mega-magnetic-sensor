# Magnetic Sensor

#### Project Overview

The **Magnetic Sensor** project demonstrates how to use a digital magnetic sensor with an Arduino Mega to detect the presence of a magnetic field. Magnetic sensors are widely used in applications such as proximity sensing, security systems, and position detection.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Mega**
- **Digital Magnetic Sensor**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the Magnetic Sensor to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Signal Pin**: Connect to digital pin 2 on Arduino Mega.
   - **VCC**: Connect to 5V on Arduino.
   - **GND**: Connect to GND on Arduino.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the Magnetic Sensor to the Arduino Mega as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.

3. **Testing:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud).
   - Observe the Serial Monitor for readings:
     - **Magnetic field detected:** Indicates that the sensor has detected a magnetic field (output is HIGH).
     - **No magnetic field detected:** Indicates that no magnetic field is detected (output is LOW).

#### Applications

- **Proximity Sensing:** Detect the presence of magnetic objects or materials.
- **Security Systems:** Trigger alerts or alarms based on changes in magnetic field.
- **Position Sensing:** Determine the position or movement of magnetic objects.

#### Notes

- Ensure the magnetic sensor is positioned and oriented correctly relative to the magnetic field you intend to detect.
- Test and adjust the sensor's sensitivity or detection range based on your application requirements.
- Consider environmental factors that may affect the sensor's performance, such as nearby magnetic sources.
